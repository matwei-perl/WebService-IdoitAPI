WebService-IdoitAPI

This module was inspired by the Python i-doit API client from Martin Vorlaender
    https://github.com/mvorl/i-doit_API

and the PHP i-doit CLI tool from Benjamin Heisig.
    https://github.com/bheisig/i-doit-cli

It is used mainly to import data into i-doit using Perl scripts,
that scrape data from various sources.
